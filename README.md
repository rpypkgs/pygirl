This repository is a living implementation of the virtual machine first
sketched in [Bruni & Verwaest
2009](https://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Brun09cPyGirl.pdf), "PyGirl:
Generating Whole-System VMs from High-Level Prototypes using PyPy". It
features video and audio output, as well as keyboard/joypad input, via SDL.
